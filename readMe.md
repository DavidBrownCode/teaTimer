I have three teas.  They are Chai, Green, and Earl Grey.

I am tryin to drink more tea, but I brew it incorrectly.  I leave the bag in too long or I use water that is too hot.  

I read that one is to start with boiling water and let it cool for a different duration for each tea.  This duration allows the water to cool to the proper brewing temperature for each tea.

Next is the proper steeping duration.  Each tea is different.

I currently have a seconds count down timer function installed.  I would like to change that to a minutes and seconds counter.

The after boil time and the steeping times change depending on the source.  I was surprised to find that the time currently set for green tea seems to offer a good cup of tea.  I would like to add web scrapping to search out times for each tea and average those times offering times for optimum tea.
